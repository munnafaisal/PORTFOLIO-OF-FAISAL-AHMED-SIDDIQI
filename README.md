### MY LEGACY WORK ON Customized Vector DB (In Memory) in 2020 
- In the mid of 2020 When first wave or CORONA hit so hard worldwide and we all got locked downed inside our home, Out of uncertainty and deppression I was just how to keep myself busy anyway.I took inspiration from from several SOTA papers and started building a **VECTOR DB** for video segment retrieval from large DB.
- Within couple of months I managed to build a **VECTOR DB** of my own using ANN(Approximate nearest neighbour), LSH, PCA and also applied some custom mathmatical operations on embeddings for better retrieval performance
